parallelize if i can't use 100% gpu 
	DummyVecEnv

retrain latest model: 
        stop episode only after not traveling far enough in x direction   

refactor code

does vecnormalize do anything? (test after finding satisfactory model)

reward for little variation in roll (make it have each leg touch the ground)

double gravity again?

foot contact with ground punishment (but not irl, just for training)

predict foot movements instead of joint position (last resort or if I want to really improve this)

maybe add rewards and punishments later on in training (like stabilization (minimizing roll variation))
